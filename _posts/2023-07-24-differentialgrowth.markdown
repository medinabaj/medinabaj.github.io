    <h1>🎓 Master Thesis: Differential Growth Curve Analysis 📊</h1>
    <p><strong>Location:</strong> Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München 📍</p>
    <p><strong>Duration:</strong> March 2023 - Present (5 months and counting ⏳)</p>
    <h2>🧪 Project Overview 🧪</h2>
    <p>I'm currently in the exciting process of developing an R package for <span class="highlight">differential growth curve analysis</span> as part of my master's thesis project. This endeavor aligns perfectly with my previous experience as a working student. </p>
    <h2>🔬 Key Responsibilities and Skills 🔬</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Conducting statistical analysis on high-dimensional data sets 📈, which provides key insights to guide critical project decisions. 💡</li>
        <li>Leveraging my R and Python 🐍 programming skills to create a powerful and user-friendly tool for analyzing growth curves with differential effects. 👩‍💻</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>🧠 Skills and Expertise 🧠</h2>
    <p>I bring a robust skill set to this project including Statistical Modeling, Computer Science, Biostatistics, Scientific Analysis, and proficiency in Python and R programming languages. 💪</p>
    <h2>🤖 On Gaussian Processes 🤖</h2>
    <p>Of note, Gaussian Processes are a key component of our analysis. Gaussian Processes (GPs) are a powerful supervised learning method 🎓. In a nutshell, they allow us to define a prior over functions and use the observed data to update our prior beliefs about the probable outputs for new inputs. GPs are particularly useful for regression problems, and excel when you have prior knowledge about the function's characteristics. 👀</p>
    <h2>🎉 Coming Soon! 🎉</h2>
    <p>I'm thrilled to announce that the R package is set to be available in November 2023! 🗓 Stay tuned for this user-friendly and powerful tool that is sure to revolutionize the way we conduct differential growth curve analysis. 🚀</p>
