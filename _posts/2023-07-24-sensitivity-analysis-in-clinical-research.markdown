# 🎓 Sensitivity Analysis in Clinical Research: A Seminar Paper 
**Institution:** Institut für Medizinische Informationsverarbeitung Biometrie und Epidemiologie (IBE), LMU Munich, Bavaria, Germany 📍

**Duration:** April 2022 - September 2022 ⏳

## 🌐 Seminar Background: Sensitivity Analysis
Despite its importance, clinical research has recently faced credibility issues due to conflicts of interest, misinterpretation and flawed exploratory analysis. This has led to incorrect study results and excessive medical waste. Sensitivity analysis is a potential solution to reduce medical waste and restore credibility to clinical trials. 

The core of sensitivity analysis is to determine how variations in methodology, models, unmeasured variable values, or assumptions can affect results. This helps to identify results that are highly dependent on unsupported assumptions, and to assess whether changes in these assumptions will lead to changes in the final interpretations or results.

## 🎯 Seminar Approach: Diving into the Depths of Sensitivity Analysis 

In the seminar, I delved deep into sensitivity analysis, exploring its various aspects, its reporting mechanisms and the different types that exist. The aim was to understand how sensitivity analysis can be used to confirm the robustness of results and to ensure a comprehensive understanding. 

The seminar paper extensively covered different aspects such as the impact of outliers, non-compliance, protocol deviation and missing data, among others. This in-depth analysis provided a nuanced understanding of the role of sensitivity analysis in strengthening the credibility of clinical trials.

## 🚀 Insights and Learnings 
As part of the seminar paper, I evaluated several studies, looking at whether sensitivity analysis was needed, where it was carried out and whether it was carried out correctly. This gave me valuable insights into the influence of assumptions on study results and the critical role of sensitivity analysis in reducing medical waste and restoring credibility to clinical research.

## 📌 Reflection and Takeaways 

This seminar has been a rewarding journey that has deepened my understanding of sensitivity analysis in clinical research. The knowledge and insights gained from the seminar have been invaluable. 🚀
