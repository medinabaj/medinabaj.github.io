My specialization in Biostatistics during my Masters journey has enabled me to gain a deep understanding of a variety of statistical methods and their application in biological and clinical studies. Let's explore some of the vital courses that have shaped my learning:

## Diagnostic Accuracy Studies

This course drilled into the design, analysis, and interpretation of diagnostic accuracy studies. It covered basic concepts and statistical techniques, but also advanced topics like dealing with imperfect reference tests and verification bias. The ability to carry out meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy studies was a major takeaway.

## Statistical Pitfalls in Biostatistics

In this course, we examined both new and established statistical methods in Biostatistics. With a focus on understanding the practical application of these techniques, we also exercised critical thinking in identifying potential pitfalls and errors. This helped me become proficient in the implementation of biostatistical methods and understand how to apply them to other research areas.

## Analysis of High Dimensional Biological Data

My Master's thesis was largely influenced by this course. We explored a variety of methods to handle high dimensional data from a computational biology perspective. I gained a critical understanding of their specific advantages and limitations, and developed a strong foundation for my further research. 

## Regression for Correlated Data

This course gave me an in-depth understanding of flexible regression models for outcomes with known dependency structures, including longitudinal, spatial, or spatio-temporal data. It instilled in me the ability to perform, critically evaluate, and correctly interpret (non-linear) regression models for correlated data using R. 

## Statistical Methods in Epidemiology 

The course enabled me to understand the main challenges and pitfalls in the design, analysis and interpretation of epidemiological studies. I was exposed to different study designs, statistical methods and causal inference techniques, which have been invaluable in my work. I also got an introduction to Bayesian methods for the analysis of communicable and non-communicable disease.

## Preclinical and Clinical Studies

This course took me through the exciting journey of drug development. We examined the key stages of this process, delving into both preclinical studies and clinical trials. I got the opportunity to understand important aspects of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modelling, as well as different statistical tools for sample size calculation and randomization. 

These courses played a fundamental role in shaping my expertise in Biostatistics, providing me with the skills necessary to address complex biological and clinical problems. Stay tuned for more insights into my Biostatistics journey!
