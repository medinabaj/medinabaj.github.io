Specialising in Biostatistics during my Master's journey has enabled me to gain a deep understanding of a variety of statistical methods and their application in biological and clinical studies. Let's explore some of the key courses that have shaped my learning:

## Diagnostic Accuracy Studies

This course covered the design, analysis and interpretation of diagnostic accuracy studies. It covered basic concepts and statistical techniques, as well as advanced topics such as dealing with imperfect reference tests and ascertainment bias. The ability to conduct meta-analyses of diagnostic accuracy studies was a key takeaway.

## Statistical Pitfalls in Biostatistics
In this course we examined both new and established statistical methods in biostatistics. With a focus on understanding the practical application of these techniques, we also practised critical thinking in identifying potential pitfalls and errors. This helped me to become proficient in the implementation of biostatistical methods and to understand how they can be applied to other areas of research.

## Analysis of high-dimensional biological data

My Master's thesis was heavily influenced by this course. We explored a variety of methods for dealing with high-dimensional data from a computational biology perspective. I gained a critical understanding of their specific advantages and limitations and developed a strong foundation for my further research. 

## Regression for Correlated Data

This course gave me an in-depth understanding of flexible regression models for outcomes with known dependence structures, including longitudinal, spatial or spatio-temporal data. It gave me the ability to run, critically evaluate and correctly interpret (non-linear) regression models for correlated data using R.

## Statistical Methods in Epidemiology 

The course enabled me to understand the main challenges and pitfalls in the design, analysis and interpretation of epidemiological studies. I was exposed to different study designs, statistical methods and causal inference techniques that have been invaluable in my work. I was also introduced to Bayesian methods for the analysis of communicable and non-communicable diseases.

## Preclinical and clinical trials

This course took me through the exciting journey of drug development. We examined the key stages of this process, looking at both preclinical studies and clinical trials. I was given the opportunity to understand important aspects of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modelling, as well as various statistical tools for sample size calculation and randomisation. 

These courses played a fundamental role in shaping my expertise in biostatistics, providing me with the skills necessary to tackle complex biological and clinical problems. Stay tuned for more insights into my biostatistics journey!
