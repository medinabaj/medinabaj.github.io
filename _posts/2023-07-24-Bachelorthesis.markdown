# 📚 Bachelor Thesis -On Value at Risk Prediction Using Quantile Regression Methods 📈
**Institution:** Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, Munich, Germany 📍
**Duration:** June 2022 - September 2022 ⏳

## 🌐 A Changing Financial Landscape: The Evolution of Risk Management
Over the years, the drastic change in trading volumes and risk management practices in financial markets has necessitated the development of robust risk estimation tools. Value at Risk (VaR) has emerged as a crucial tool for estimating financial risk, but traditional VaR estimators often fall short when dealing with real-world data. Hence, the focus has shifted towards developing more robust tools like Quantile Regression. 📉

## 💡 Approach: Quantile Regression for Robust Risk Estimation
In this project, I delved deep into Quantile Regression, a technique perfectly suited for estimating VaR, and known for its robustness against extreme shocks. The project covers the fundamentals of Quantile Regression and discusses the Quantile Treatment Effect and Equivariance, providing a thorough understanding of this robust risk management tool. 📊

## 🎯 Contributions: New Approaches and Future Directions
The project offers an in-depth exploration of various models and methodologies related to Quantile Regression and VaR. It introduces and evaluates three key approaches: Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA), Historical Simulation, and the Quantile Regression Approach. The thesis concludes with potential future research directions in this field. 

## 🧠 Skills and Acquired Knowledge
Throughout this project, I honed a range of skills, including Statistical Modeling, Financial Analysis, R programming, and Risk Management. The objective was to shed light on Quantile Regression as a robust risk management tool and its applications in financial markets. 📚
