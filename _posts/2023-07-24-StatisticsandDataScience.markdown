Embarking on my Masters in Statistics and Data Science was a fascinating journey, filled with the thrill of uncovering complex concepts, facing challenges head-on, and making meaningful connections between theoretical and practical aspects. Here, I would like to share a sneak peek into some of the most impactful courses I undertook and the key insights I gained from them:

## 1. Statistical Modeling

This course provided a comprehensive overview of a wide range of regression models including generalized linear and additive models, mixed models, and duration time/survival models, among others. We dove deep into the realm of latent variable models, measurement errors, model selection strategies, and beyond mean regression. An intriguing part of this course was the introduction to Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and causal inference.

Through this course, I developed a deep understanding of model building, diagnostics, and selection. I learned how to apply different types of statistical models in real-world scenarios, formalize research questions, and interpret statistical results. The lecture series also allowed me to gain insights into current research in statistical modelling.

## 2. Supervised Learning

The Supervised Learning course was a deep dive into the theoretical foundations of machine learning and its most prominent methods. The course covered the principles of risk minimization, information theory, the curse of dimensionality, and methods of regularization. Furthermore, we explored different prominent learning algorithms such as support vector machines, Gaussian processes, and boosting.

Through this course, I not only grasped the theoretical underpinnings of machine learning but also acquired the practical skills to implement advanced ML techniques. I learned how to select appropriate modeling approaches in various scenarios, bridging the gap between theory and application.

## 3. Statistical Inference

The course on Statistical Inference provided me with an in-depth understanding of various estimation and inference techniques. We started with the classical theory of point estimation and tests, exploring concepts such as loss function, risk function, and multiple testing procedures. The course then took us through likelihood-based estimation of statistical models and Bayesian inference methods, including modern sampling approaches.

This course enabled me to gain a profound understanding of the fundamental concepts of statistical inference and reasoning. I learned how to use important tools for parameter estimation and the estimation of the distributions of these estimates. I also understood the preconditions, methodological framing, strengths, and weaknesses of each approach.

My journey in the Master of Statistics and Data Science has equipped me with not just academic knowledge but a deeper understanding of real-world data dynamics. As I look back at this journey, I am more excited than ever to leverage my learnings and skills to make data-driven decisions and contribute to the ever-evolving field of data science.
