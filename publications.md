      <p>Antimicrobial resistance is a global threat that necessitates faster discovery of new antibiotics. We introduce a computational strategy using MolE, a deep learning framework, to predict the antimicrobial potential of compounds. Our model identified novel growth-inhibitory compounds, including three new inhibitors of Staphylococcus aureus, offering a promising, cost-effective approach to accelerating antibiotic discovery.</p>

      <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Anna Janina Stephan, Michael Hanselmann, <strong>Medina Bajramovic</strong>, Simon Schosser, Michael Laxy</p>
      <p>Digitalization and big health system data offer new opportunities for targeted prevention and treatment strategies. We developed and validated prediction algorithms for stroke and myocardial infarction (MI) in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients using German health insurance claims data. Our findings show that claims-based algorithms, using both traditional regression and machine/deep learning methods, perform comparably to existing epidemiological models, with regression-based approaches offering a transparent, scalable, and low-cost solution for cardiovascular risk stratification.</p>

The relationship between effort, learning effect and product quality during hackathons of novice teams</a></h2>

      <p>Design education prepares novice designers to solve complex problems with diverse skill sets and an interdisciplinary approach. Hackathons offer hands-on, collaborative learning in a short time frame, emphasizing practical experience and problem-solving. This paper presents an empirical study from a 2-week academic hackathon, examining the relationship between product quality, learning effect, and effort. Data on effort, self-assessed learning, and product quality were collected from 30 teams. The study found a moderate correlation between effort and product quality, but no significant correlation between product quality and learning effect.</p>
