      <p>Digitalization and big health system data open new avenues for targeted prevention and treatment strategies. Despite their ubiquitarian availability, it remains unknown if health insurance claims can identify patients at high complication risk. We developed and validated prediction algorithms for stroke and myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) based on claims and compared predictive performance of traditional regression with state-of-the-art machine and deep learning (ML/DL) methods.</p>
      <p>Methods: We used German 2014-2019 claims with 287 predictors of 3-year MI and stroke risk. Following a train-test split approach, we applied logistic models with and without forward selection, LASSO-regularization, random forests (RF), gradient boosting (GB), multi-layer-perceptrons (MLP), and feature-tokenizer transformers (FTT). We assessed discrimination (Areas Under the Receiver-Operator and Precision-Recall Curves, AUROC and AUPRC) and calibration.</p>
      <p>Findings: Among n=371,006 T2D patients (mean age: 67·2 years), 3·5% (n=13,030) had MIs and 3·4% (n=12,701) strokes. AUPRCs were 0·035 (MI) and 0·034 (stroke) for a null model and between 0·082 (MLP) and 0·092 (GB) for MI and between 0·061 (MLP) and 0·073 (GB) for stroke. AUROCs were 0·5 for null models, between 0·70 (RF, MLP, FTT) and 0·71 (all others) for MI and between 0·66 (MLP) and 0·69 (GB) for stroke.</p>
      <p>Interpretation: Performance of claims-based algorithms was comparable to existing epidemiological models incorporating clinical information. ML/DL did not outperform regression-based approaches. Applying regression-based approaches may be a transparent scalable low-cost approach for cardiovascular risk stratification.</p>

      <p>Design education prepares novice designers to solve complex and challenging problems requiring diverse skill sets and an interdisciplinary approach. Hackathons, for example, offer a hands-on, collaborative learning approach in a limited time frame to gain practical experience and develop problem-solving skills quickly. They enable collaboration, prototyping and testing among interdisciplinary teams. Typically, hackathons strongly focus on the solution, assuming that this will support learning. However, building the best product and achieving a strong learning effect may not be related. This paper presents the results of an empirical study that examines the relationship between product quality, learning effect and effort spent in an academic 2-week hackathon. Thirty teams identified user problems in this course and developed hardware and mechatronic products. This study collected the following data: (1) effort spent during the hackathon through task tracking, (2) learning effect through self-assessment by the participants and (3) product quality after the hackathon by an external jury. The study found that the team effort spent has a statistically significant but moderate correlation with product quality. The correlation between product quality and learning effect is statistically insignificant, suggesting that for this setting, there is no relevant association.</p>

      <p>The rise in antimicrobial resistance poses a worldwide threat, reducing the efficacy of common antibiotics. Determining the antimicrobial activity of new chemical compounds through experimental methods is still a time-consuming and costly endeavor. Compound-centric deep learning models hold the promise to speed up this search and prioritization process.</p>
      <p>Here, we introduce a lightweight computational strategy for antimicrobial discovery that builds on MolE(Molecular representation through redundancy reduced Embedding), a deep learning framework that leverages unlabeled chemical structures to learn task-independent molecular representations. By combining MolE representation learning with experimentally validated compound-bacteria activity data, we design a general predictive model that enables assessing compounds with respect to their antimicrobial potential.</p>
      <p>The model correctly identified recent growth-inhibitory compounds that are structurally distinct from current antibiotics and discovered de novo three human-targeted drugs as Staphylococcus aureus growth inhibitors which we experimentally confirmed. Our framework offers a viable cost-effective strategy to accelerate antibiotics discovery.</p>
